<pre>In the vibrant city of <b>Khansaar</b> during the year <em>1985</em>, two inseparable friends, Deva and Vardharaja “Vardha” Mannar, were united by fate in a tumultuous atmosphere. The metropolis was 
    under a monarchical regime, ruled by Raja Mannar, Vardha’s father. During this pivotal year, the Shouryaanga tribe faced a horrific fate at the hands of Raja Mannar, an event that would irrevocably alter the lives of Deva and his mother. 
     After a violent mob targeted their home, it was none other than Vardha who stepped in to protect them, granting them a lifeline in exchange for their lives. As Deva left Khansaar, he pledged to return 
     whenever Vardha called, unaware that destiny had further plans for them.Jumping to 2017, we meet Krishnakanth, a conflicted businessman battling his own demons as his daughter Aadhya arrives from New York 
     in search of answers regarding her mother’s demise. However, unbeknownst to Krishnakanth, this return sets off an elaborate scheme orchestrated by his old foes who aim to exploit Aadhya’s fragile state. 
     Preparing to defend her, Krishnakanth enlists the help of Bilal, a loyal confidant, who cleverly maneuvers to safeguard Aadhya within Deva’s modest residence in Tinsukia, Assam.
     As Aadhya begins posing as an English teacher at the local school—where Deva’s mother serves as the headmaster—she unwittingly gets entangled in larger conspiracies. Meanwhile, Deva’s mother grows increasingly 
     anxious as she discerns the danger closing in on Aadhya. In a desperate move, she devises a plan for their escape, but they are ultimately abducted in a convoy marked with the mysterious Khansaar insignia, thwarting her efforts.</pre>
